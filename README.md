# Tanks on a Plain

> Our submission for the Github GameOff 2022 Game Jam.

Tanks on a Plain is an open-source action game made with the Unity engine.<br>
This years theme was **cliché**. We tried to integrate this by focussing on the gaming cliché of collecting power ups.

## The Game

Your goal is to survive as long as you can!

You will encounter hoards of enemy tanks attacking you.<br>
Destroy them and collect their power ups to gain strength.

But beware, the enemy tanks will also collect and use the power ups to get even stronger!

> WASD - Move<br>
> Mouse - Aim<br>
> Left Mouse - Shoot

## Installation

Download the [latest game binaries](https://github.com/EuleMitKeule/github-gameoff-2022/releases) according to your operating system, extract them and start the game.<br>
